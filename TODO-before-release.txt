Things which should be done before releasing this software, in order of
their priority.

- Calculate real delta v and acceleration of all flight phases.
 - This info should be printed, as tuples of "delta v, pressure,
   acceleration at start and end of phase, type of engine, mass at start
   end end of phase"
 - Info should be used to determine whether design cumplies minimum
   acceleration constraint.
 - Minimum acceleration constraint should be given per flight phase, not
   global, as dv[:acc[:p]] tuples i.e. "905:13:1.0 3650:13:0.18" as
   Kerbin launch, "1170 1160:3.3 310" for flight from LKO to Mun and
   back to Kerbin, acc (minimum acceleration) and p (pressure) both
   defaulting to 0.0. Note that this also defines a User Interface
   change, as well as an enhancement of physics calculation.
 - It might be considered an advantage that less delta v is done by
   not-controllable solid fuel boosters.

- Consider remaining types of engines, i.e.
 - Nuclear fission motor,
 - Ion propulsion,
 - Monopropellant engines,
 - Twin-Boar, having tank included.

- Review and test physics.py. Note that this is the most important part
  of the tool, as it would be useless if the designs do not have the
  exact quantity of fuel needed.
 - Also see point 1.
 - There should be unit tests, as this is easily testable.
 - Check in which cases the solver is not able to find a solution.
   Eventually use alternative, but equivalent specification of
   equations.
 - Check plausibility of solutions.
 - Test, test, test. (also building rockets)
 - Avoid obvious things reducing performance

- Consider that radially mounted engines might be an advantage.

- Consider that engines generating electricity might be advantageous.

- Consider adapters between different radial sizes.
 - There should be an option for upper radial size.
 - There should be an option for not using smaller sizes than upper
   radial size.
 - There should be an option to disable usage of adapters (but still
   changing size, as preferrence of keeping size can be expressed using
   --preferred-size option)

- Consider mounting multiple small engines on bi-coupler, tri-coupler,
  etc.. This option should be disable-able.

- Review and test IsBest algorithm.

- Code quality (commenting, function names, code style, etc.)

- Verify parts.py correctness for current KSP version

- Heavily test everything, also create automated tests.

- Documentation and User Interface.
 - Write good README.md with examples.
 - Let kspalculator.py print all constraints for double-checking, unless
   --quiet option is given.
 - Rework --help.
 - Check validity of given options.

- One more time: Test and review code.
